# Views and Layouts

This document describes how the MkDocs Notion Plugin handles different views and layouts when converting your documentation to Notion pages.

## View Types

The plugin supports various view types in Notion:

| View Type | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Document | Standard document view | Default view for most documentation pages |
| Table | Tabular data view | Displaying structured data and comparisons |
| Gallery | Card-based view | Showcasing features or examples |
| List | Simple list view | Quick reference and indexes |

## Layout Elements

### Headers and Navigation

The plugin preserves your document's structure by:

1. Converting MkDocs headers to Notion headings
2. Maintaining the hierarchy of your content
3. Adding navigation between pages
4. Preserving table of contents when present

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are rendered with proper syntax highlighting:

```python
def example_function():
    """Example function for demonstration."""
    return "Hello from MkDocs Notion Plugin!"
```

### Tables and Lists

Tables are converted to native Notion tables:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Basic Tables | ✅ | Fully supported |
| Complex Tables | ✅ | Including merged cells |
| List Items | ✅ | Both ordered and unordered |

## Best Practices

> **Tip**: When designing your documentation layout, consider how it will be displayed in Notion.

Some recommendations:

- Use consistent heading levels
- Keep tables simple and well-structured
- Include clear navigation paths
- Test different view types for optimal presentation

## Technical Details

The view conversion process follows these steps:

1. Parse the original Markdown/HTML
2. Map elements to Notion blocks
3. Apply appropriate styling
4. Create navigation links
5. Optimize for Notion's interface
